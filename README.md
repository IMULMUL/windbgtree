# WinDBGtree
=============

WinDBGtree is a WinDbg command tree that expands the set of available commands by Microsoft Windows Debugger aka WinDBG.
Windbgtree comes up making life easier for Windows kernel researchers, Windows Internals troubleshooters and also security experts.

This WinDBGtree has been created by Vagner Pilar @vagnerpilar (Twitter) â€“ Feel free to reach me out on https://twitter.com/vagnerpilar asking for more features, offering to contribute and any kind of feedback.

# Installation
===============

You can copy the WinDbgtree.txt file in the corresponding (x86 or x64) WinDbg folder and load it manually using the .cmdtree command such as below or adding the path on the WinDBG shortcut.

# Example:
===========

```
kd> .cmdtree C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\windbgtree.txt
